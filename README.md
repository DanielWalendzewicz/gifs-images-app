# gifs-images-app

I've added a simple Node.js server that is responsible for fetching images and gifs, Frontend application based on React Hooks consisting of functional components. Components use functionalities that block unnecessary rendering.
I've configured webapack to use CSS modules. 

In next steps I would add :
- Eslint to imporve the code syntax
- Controlles to Node.js server
- Tests
- Components for photos and gifs
- Better state managment
